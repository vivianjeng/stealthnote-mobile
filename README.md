# Stealthnote Mobile

This project is inspired by [stealthnote.xyz](https://stealthnote.xyz). Our goal is to build on the core idea of StealthNote while significantly enhancing performance and user experience using [Mopro](https://zkmopro.org). By leveraging native execution, our implementation achieves at least **~10×** faster performance compared to the browser-based version — as demonstrated in our [benchmarks](#-benchmarks).

## 🎯 Features

-   **Sign in with Google OAuth**: When a user signs in with Google on StealthNote, an ephemeral key is generated. The platform then requests a JWT from Google OAuth to prove ownership of the user's email address, using the hash of the ephemeral key as a nonce. A Noir proof is generated to attest to the validity of the JWT and the nonce, and this proof is submitted to the server. Upon verification, the server creates a membership record tied to the user's organizational email.

-   **Create note**: After signing in with Google OAuth and storing the ephemeral key, users can use the key to post content on the platform.

-   **Toggle likes**: Just like creating a note, users can use their ephemeral public key to toggle likes on the platform.

-   **Verify proofs**: Each message box includes a "Verify" button, allowing any user to verify the corresponding Noir proof stored in the database and confirm its authenticity via Google OAuth.

-   **Internal chat**: Internal chats are visible only to members of the same organization who choose to post internally. Stealthnote uses the user's ephemeral public key to authenticate message posting and retrieval.

## 💻 How it is made?

-   **Rust:** All cryptographic functions are implemented in Rust, as the ecosystem offers a richer set of libraries and better performance compared to Flutter. Below is an overview of our implementation.

    -   `generate_ephemeral_key()`: Stealthnote uses an ephemeral key for performing actions and verifying membership. We implemented Ed25519 signature functionality and hashes in Rust to ensure secure and efficient cryptographic operations.
    -   `prove_jwt()`: The `prove_jwt` function extracts the necessary data for the Noir circuit and invokes the [noir-rs](https://github.com/zkmopro/noir-rs) proof generation function to produce a valid Noir proof.
    -   `verify_jwt_proof()`: The `verify_jwt_proof` function retrieves inputs from the database, formats them for the Noir circuit, and uses noir-rs to verify the corresponding proof.

-   **Mopro:** Mopro generates native bindings for iOS and Android, allowing the Flutter app to call Rust-defined functions simply by replacing the generated bindings.
-   **Flutter:** Flutter is used to build our cross-platform frontend. It handles the Google authentication flow to obtain a JWT, and communicates with the Stealthnote.xyz APIs to interact with the backend.

## 🔧 Build the Bindings

Mopro simplifies generating native mobile bindings through the mopro CLI. The following example demonstrates how to update the bindings when changes are made to the underlying [Rust functions](./src/lib.rs). This allows developers to focus solely on maintaining the Rust functions, while automatically ensuring cross-platform support.

### Install Mopro CLI

Follow the [Getting Started](https://zkmopro.org/docs/getting-started) page to install `mopro` CLI.

### iOS

Run

```sh
mopro build
```

and select `aarch64-apple-ios`

### Android

Activate `android-compat` feature in [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml).

```diff
- noir = { git = "https://github.com/zkmopro/noir-rs", features = ["barretenberg"] }
+ noir = { git = "https://github.com/zkmopro/noir-rs", features = ["barretenberg", "android-compat"] }
```

Run

```sh
mopro build
```

and select `aarch64-linux-android`

## 🔄 Manually Update Bindings

### Flutter

Copy the generated files into your Flutter project:

```sh
cp -r MoproiOSBindings flutter/mopro_flutter_plugin/ios && \
cp -r MoproAndroidBindings/uniffi flutter/mopro_flutter_plugin/android/src/main/kotlin && \
cp -r MoproAndroidBindings/jniLibs flutter/mopro_flutter_plugin/android/src/main
```

## 📂 Open the project

Follow the instructions to open the development tools

### Flutter

-   Go to `flutter` directory

    ```sh
    cd flutter
    ```

-   Check flutter environment

    ```sh
    flutter doctor
    ```

-   Install Flutter Dependencies

    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

-   Run the app (Please turn on emulators before running the command)
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

## 📊 Benchmarks

The following benchmarks were conducted on iPhone and Android in release mode:

| JWT Operation              | Prove    | Verify  |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Browser                    | 37.292 s | 0.286 s |
| Desktop (Mac M1 Pro)       | 2.02 s   | 0.007 s |
| Android emulator (Pixel 8) | 4.786 s  | 3.013 s |
